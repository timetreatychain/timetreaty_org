    SCHEDULE 1
    Limitation of Liability
    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions in this Schedule 2 shall operate to limit the liability of Vendor in respect of any claim by Buyer.
    1.Warranties 
    The several representations and warranties of Vendor (“Vendor’s Warranties”) and such other covenants, undertakings and indemnities expressly set out in this Agreement are the only representations, warranties, undertakings or other assurances of any kind given by or on behalf of Vendor to Buyer and all other warranties, expressed or implied by law, trade, custom, usage or otherwise are hereby expressly excluded by Vendor.
    2.Time Limitation
    Vendor shall not be liable in any way or in any event in respect of any claim under this Agreement if such claim was not made in the period commencing from the Settlement Date to the date falling six (6) months after the Settlement Date (such period being the “Claim Period”). Any claim or indemnity claim which has been made before the expiration of the Claim Period shall, if it has not been previously satisfied in full, settled or withdrawn, be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall become fully barred and unenforceable on the expiry of the period of six (6) months commencing from the date on which such claim was made, unless proceedings in respect thereof shall have been commenced against Vendor and for this purpose proceedings shall not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall have been issued and served upon Vendor.
    3.Buyer shall not be entitled to recover or otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution from Vendor under this Agreement more than once in respect of the same damage suffered.
    4	For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Schedule 2 shall limit Buyer’s obligation (at law or otherwise) to mitigate its loss in respect of any claim under this Agreement, and Buyer shall not be entitled to recover damages in respect of any claim (as the case may be) if, and to the extent that, Buyer have already recovered damages in respect of the same fact or subject matter.
    5.	Vendor shall not be liable under any circumstances for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss arising from any breach of the Vendor’s Warranties.
    
     
    
    EXHIBIT 1
    Token Characteristics 
    In this Agreement, the “Token” shall mean the BIDT.
    TTC Token
    
    Token name: BIDT
    Token symbol: BIDT
    
    TTC Token Functions 
    
    ·The TTC Token is the native token of the TTC project. TTC Token can be used across applications.
    
    ·TTC Token are intended to be issued as incentives to miners, developers and users for their contributions to the TTC project.
    
    **Further functionality may be added by the development team as research and development around the project continues. Information on such functionality will be made available to Buyer on updated versions of the White Paper which will be made available to Buyer via the website: www.timetreaty.org**
    
    EXHIBIT 2
    Risk Factors 
    
    RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE
    
    Investments in startups such as Foundation and Vendor involve a high degree of risk. 
    
    Financial and operating risks confronting startups are significant and Foundation and Vendor are not immune to these. Startups often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.
    
    Foundation and/or Vendor may be forced to cease operations.
    
    It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the inability by Foundation and/or Vendor to establish the TTC project or the Token' utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, Foundation and/or Vendor may no longer be viable to operate and Foundation and/or Vendor may dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution of Foundation and/or Vendor.
    
    The Agreement may not be transferred.
    
    The terms of the Agreement provide that Buyer may not transfer or assign the Agreement without the consent of Vendor and only if such transfer is in compliance with the Laws of applicable Governmental Authorities.
    
    The tax treatment of the Agreement, the purchase rights contained therein and the Token distribution is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for Buyers upon certain future events.
    The tax characterization of the Agreement and the Token is uncertain, and each Buyer must seek its own tax advice in connection with an investment in the Token. An investment pursuant to the Agreement and the purchase of Token pursuant thereto may result in adverse tax consequences to Buyer, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. Each Buyer should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors with respect tax treatment of an investment in the Token pursuant to the Agreement.
    
    There is no prior market for Token and the Token Distribution may not result in an active or liquid market for the Token 
    
    Prior to the Token Distribution, there has been no public market for the Token. In the event that the Token are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Token will develop or if developed, be sustained after the Token have been made available for trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that the market price of the Token will not decline below the Purchase Consideration. The Purchase Consideration may not be indicative of the market price of the Token after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
    
    A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. Vendor is not responsible for nor does it pursue the circulation and trading of Token on the market. Trading of Token merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of the Token, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of Token to any extent at any time. Accordingly, Vendor cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for Token, or that the Purchase Consideration is indicative of the market price of Token after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
    
    Future sales of the Token could materially and adversely affect the market price of Token
    
    Any future sale of the Token (which were not available for sale in the Token Distribution) would increase the supply of Token in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on the Token. The sale or distribution of a significant number of Token outside of the Token Distribution, or the perception that such further sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Token.
    
    Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Token
    
    Negative publicity involving (a) Foundation and/or Vendor; (b) the Project; (c) the Token; or (d) any of the key personnel of Foundation or Vendor, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Token, whether or not such publicity is justified. 
    
    There is no assurance of any success of the Project
    
    The value of, and demand for, the Token hinges heavily on the performance of the TTC project. There is no assurance that the TTC project will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. 
    
    The TTC project has not been fully developed, finalized and integrated and is subject to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, and hence impact its success. 
    
    
    The trading price of the Token may fluctuate following the Token Distribution Event
    
    The prices of cryptographic Token in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, and corresponding the market price of, the Token may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond the control of Foundation and Vendor:
    
    (a)new technical innovations;
    
    (b)analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the Token’s market price or Foundation’s and/or Vendor’s financial and business performance;
    
    (c)changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations similar to that of Foundation and/or Vendor that may be made available for sale and purchase on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the Token;
    
    (d)announcements by Foundation and/or Vendor of significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new product developments;
    
    (e)fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges;
    
    (f)additions or departures of key personnel of Foundation and/or Vendor;
    
    (g)success or failure of the management of Foundation and/or Vendor in implementing business and growth strategies; and
    
    (h)changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry, the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other events or factors.
    
    The funds raised in the Token Distribution are exposed to risks of theft
      
    Whilst Vendor will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the Token Sale are securely held at the receiving address(es) at which the Purchase Consideration is received (“Receiving Address(es)”) through the implementation of security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Receiving Address(es), the Ethereum blockchain, or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the Token Distribution is completed, Vendor may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and Vendor may not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the TTC project, and the launch of the TTC project might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, the issued Token may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price. The Token are uninsured, unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of any loss or loss of value, you may have no recourse.
    
    RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESS AND WALLETS
    
    The Receiving Address(es) may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may not be able to be disbursed
    
    The Receiving Address(es) are designed to be secure. However, in the event that the Receiving Address(es) are, for any reason compromised (including but not limited to scenarios of the loss of keys to such Receiving Address(es)), the funds held at the Receiving Address(es) may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the Token Distribution is successful, Vendor will not be able to receive the funds raised and Vendor will not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the TTC project, and the implementation of the TTC project might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed Token may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price. 
    
    The loss or compromise of information relating to your Wallet (as defined below) may affect your access and possession of the Token
    
    For purposes of receipt of your Token, you are to establish and maintain access to a cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”). Your access to the Token in the Wallet depends on, among other things, the safeguards to the information to such Wallet, including but not limited to the user account information, address, private key and password. In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your access to the Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affecting your access and possession to the Token, including such Token being unrecoverable and permanently lost.
    
    The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Token
    
    The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Token which may result in the delivery of Token being unsuccessful or affect your access to such Token.
    
    RISKS RELATING TO FOUNDATION AND/OR VENDOR 
    
    The TTC project is intended to be developed, operated and maintained by the Foundation upon its incorporation. Any events or circumstances which adversely affect the Foundation may have a corresponding adverse effect on the TTC project if such events or circumstances affect the Foundation’s ability to maintain the TTC project. This would correspondingly have an impact the trading price of the Token.
    
    The Foundation may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the TTC project and consequently the trading price of the Token.
    
    The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in which the Foundation will compete have grown rapidly and continue to grow rapidly, and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances, changing business models and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing environment, the Foundation may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of the Foundation will depend on its ability to manage its operations, adapt to technological advances and market trends and ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees, and provide proper training for its personnel. As its business evolves, the Foundation must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. The Foundation’s business will rely on its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology, and to manage technical support infrastructure for the TTC project effectively, the Foundation will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that the Foundation will not control. If the Foundation is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If the third parties whom the Foundation will rely on are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services the Foundation utilizes, the integrity and availability of its internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information, and economic loss. The loss of financial, labour or other resources, and any other adverse effect on the Foundation’s business, financial condition and operations, would have a direct adverse effect on the Foundation’s ability to maintain the TTC project. As the TTC project is the main product to which the Token relate, this may adversely impact the trading price of the Token.
    
    The Foundation may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Foundation’s infrastructure network, and/or the TTC project
    
    The Foundation will be unable to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks),  distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the TTC project, the Token, the Receiving Address(es), the  Wallet or any technology (including but not limited to smart contract technology) on which Foundation and/or Vendor, the TTC project, the Token, the Receiving Address(es) and the  Wallet relies or on the Ethereum blockchain or any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Foundation may not be able to detect such hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession. 
    
    The Foundation’s network or services, which would include the TTC project, could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of which are beyond the Foundation’s control. Although the Foundation will be taking steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the TTC project and its other services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, and that any of the Foundation’s intended enhanced security measures will be effective. The Foundation may also be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to the Foundation and users of the TTC project. Any significant breach of the Foundation’s intended security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of the Foundation’s network or services (including the TTC project) may adversely affect the trading price of the Token.
    
    The Foundation will be dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third parties
    
    The Foundation’s infrastructure network will be in part established through servers that which it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data centre facilities of third parties. If the Foundation is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Foundation may be required to transfer its servers to a new data centre facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, the Foundation and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any such security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon the Foundation’s infrastructure network and/or the TTC project may adversely impact the price of the Token.
    
    General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the Foundation’s operating performance, results of operations and cash flows
    
    The Foundation could be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on the Foundation’s business, operations and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, the Foundation may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the TTC project. Suppliers on which the Foundation will rely for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the Foundation’s operations or expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on the Foundation’s business, financial condition and results of operations and hence the TTC project, which would correspondingly impact the trading price of the Token.
    
    The Foundation, the Vendor and/or the Token may be affected by newly implemented regulations
    
    Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. The Foundation, the Vendor and/or the Token may be affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets, including having to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial modifications to the Token and/or the TTC project. This may impact the appeal of the Token and/or the TTC project for users and result in decreased usage of the Token and/or the TTC project. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the Token and/or TTC project may no longer be commercially viable and Foundation and/or Vendor may opt to discontinue the Token and/or the TTC project. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Token and the TTC project. Foundation and/or Vendor may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the trading price of Token will be adversely affected or Token may cease to be traded.
    
    The regulatory regime governing the blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, Token and token offerings such as Token Distribution and the Token is uncertain, and regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the TTC project and the utility of the Token
    
    Regulation of Token (including the Token) and token offerings such as this, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges currently is undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States of America and in other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the TTC project and the adoption and utility of the Token. Failure by Foundation, Vendor or users of the TTC project to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.
    Buyers will have no control on Foundation or Vendor
    Buyers are not and will not be entitled, to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of capital stock of Foundation or Vendor for any purpose, nor will anything be construed to confer on the Buyers any of the rights of a stockholder of Foundation or Vendor or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise.
    Buyers may lack information for monitoring their investment
    Buyers may not be able to obtain all information it would want regarding the Foundation, the Vendor, the Token, or the TTC project, on a timely basis or at all. It is possible that Buyers may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have occurred. While the Vendor will make efforts to use open-source development for Token, this information may be highly technical by nature. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, Buyers may not have accurate or accessible information about the TTC project.
    
    There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Token
    
    Cryptographic Token such as the Token are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included in this Exhibit 2, there are other risks associated with the purchase, holding and use of the Token, including those that Foundation or Vendor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit 2.
    
    
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
